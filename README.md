# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML | logistic-regression
CONTEXT:
Day by day the cases of heart diseases are increasing at a rapid rate and it’s very Important and concerning to predict any such diseases beforehand.

METADATA:

age: age in years

sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp: chest pain type -- Value 0: typical angina -- Value 1: atypical angina -- Value 2: non-anginal pain -- Value 3: asymptomatic

trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results -- Value 0: normal -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment -- Value 0: upsloping -- Value 1: flat -- Value 2: downsloping

ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect and the label

target: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease

APPROACH:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Split it into training and testing data using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn, and train a logistic regression model on the training data.
Evaluate the accuracy of model on both the training and testing data.
Finally, design a system so that the model can be used to predict whether a new input data point (representing information about a person's health) indicates whether the person has heart disease or not. The prediction result is printed to the console along with a message indicating whether the person is healthy or has heart disease.
PACKAGES USED:

Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit Learn.
